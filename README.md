How to start application: 
I have included a shell script to start the application which will take care of the background process
- Clone the repository
- open the docker
- In project directory run ./start.sh


API's and their responses:


1. http://localhost:8080//apica/user/register
   - Request type : POST
   - Paylod sample: {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "password": "securePassword123",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "roles": [
        "USER",
        "ADMIN"
    ]
}
sample response: {
    "id": 2,
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "roles": [
        "ADMIN",
        "USER"
    ]
}
This api is available for public users and can be accessible without a JWT token.
I have used JWT tokens for authentication and authorization
so first we have to create JWT with the credentials that we have registered

AuthController:
 http://localhost:8080/auth/login
  - Request Type : POST
  - Sample Payload: {"username" : "john_doe","password" : "securePassword123"}
  - Sample response: {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJzYWhpbCIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDU4MTQ0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ0NjE3NDQxfQ.w_1R1GfUOpRy9inhPxnOCyctm-Zq63R9LXnbeAHyM6I"
}


So, with the JWT token generated we can be able to access all other endpoints
